# Best practices

## Coding Standards

1. **Naming Conventions:** Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Follow established naming conventions for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. **Modularization:** Break down your code into modular components for better maintainability and reusability.

3. **Global Text Styles:** When creating global text styles classnames, use the `text-` prefix for clarity and consistency.

4. **Private Data** Safeguard API keys and credentials by using secure storage solutions. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information within the codebase.

## Version Control

1. **Branching Strategy:** Follow a clear branching strategy, to manage feature development, bug fixes, and releases.

2. **Commit Messages:** Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Include relevant information about the changes made in each commit.

3. **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to catch issues early and ensure code quality. Provide constructive feedback to team members.

## Accessibility

1. **Semantic HTML:** Use semantic HTML elements to enhance accessibility and improve SEO.

2. **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible and navigable using a keyboard.

3. **ARIA Roles:** Use ARIA roles to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content and single-page applications.

## SEO Best Practices

1. **Metadata Optimization:**

   - Optimize meta tags, including title, description, and keywords, for improved search engine visibility.
   - Use unique and descriptive meta tags for each page.

2. **XML Sitemap:**

   - Generate and maintain an XML sitemap to help search engines index your site efficiently.
   - Submit the sitemap to major search engines regularly.

3. **Structured Data:**

   - Implement structured data using schema.org vocabulary to enhance search engine understanding of your content.
   - Include structured data for entities like articles, events, and products.

4. **Readable URLs**

   - Create clean, readable, and SEO-friendly URLs that reflect the content of the page.
   - Use hyphens to separate words in URLs.

5. **Optimize Images:**

   - Compress and optimize images to reduce file sizes without compromising quality.
   - Use descriptive file names and include alt attributes for images.

6. **Clean and Semantic HTML:**

   - Write well-structured, semantic HTML code that accurately represents the content hierarchy.
   - Use appropriate HTML5 tags and elements.

7. **Header Tags (H1, H2, etc.)**

   - Use header tags to structure content and provide hierarchy.
   - Ensure that the H1 tag represents the main topic of the page.

8. **Canonical Tags:**
   - Use canonical tags to avoid duplicate content issues and specify the preferred version of a page.

## Animation and Transitions

1. **Performance Considerations:**

   - Opt for CSS animations and transitions over JavaScript-based animations for better performance.
   - Minimize the use of complex animations, especially on critical paths, to maintain smooth user experiences.

2. **GPU Acceleration:**

   - Leverage GPU acceleration by using CSS properties like `transform-gpu` for smoother animations.
   - Be mindful of triggering layout changes, as it may impact performance negatively.

3. **Timing Functions:**

   - Choose appropriate timing functions (ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out) to create natural and visually pleasing animations.
   - Experiment with custom cubic-bezier functions for more fine-tuned control.

4. **Responsiveness:**

   - Design animations that enhance responsiveness and guide users' attention.
   - Ensure animations adapt well to various screen sizes and devices.

5. **Accessibility:**

   - Ensure that animated content remains accessible to users with disabilities.
   - Provide descriptive alternative content or announcements for screen reader users.

6. **Consistency:**

   - Maintain consistency in animation styles and durations across your application.
   - Use a standardized set of easing functions and transition durations for a cohesive experience.

7. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Test animations on various browsers and devices to ensure consistent behavior.
